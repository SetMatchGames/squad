From MOBAs to Minecraft, video game mods have played a huge role in
building today’s gaming industry. But mod ecosystems are difficult to
build, and most game developers decide not to include mod systems.

The Squad Games Platform offers a radical new way to build video games
with mods in mind, to the mutual benefit of game devs, mod-makers, and
players. With Squad Games, anyone can submit new mods to your game,
those mods are well curated, and the value created brings in new
players. Revenues are shared between mod-makers and game developers.

We’re hard at work building the decentralized protocol and developer
tools needed for the Squad Games Platform, and we are looking for
design partners! If you are a game developer interested in building a
mod-enabled game, please get in touch on the Squad Games Discord.
