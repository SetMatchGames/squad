We are hard at work writing the full protocol paper but here are the
highlights.

Games built for the Squad protocol give players and modders finantial
stake in their gaming communities by tokenizing their contributions
and setting up all the needed infrastructure.

Squad emopowers game designers to compete on the basis of speed by
inviting their communities in early to join in its development.
Designers get the tools to launch a game quick, build a community
driven by a market around it then transition ownership and
responsibility for future development and maintenance to the community
when network effects begin to dominate.

All contributors get tools for earning returns on the success of their
contributions.
