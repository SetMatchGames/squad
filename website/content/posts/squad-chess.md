Squad Chess is the first game built for Squad Games to demonstrate
what's possible.

It's a moddable version of chess allowing the community to create new
chess pieces and new formats. You could create a king that moves like a
pawn but takes like a knight. You can make any starting position and
any board size and shape then submit your new pieces and formats others
to buy and play.

Try it out out at [chess.squad.games](https://chess.squad.games)
though it's still an early prototype.
