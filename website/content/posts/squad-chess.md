Squad Chess is the first game built using the Squad Games Platform,
meant as a demonstration.

Itâ€™s a moddable version of chess that lets users create new chess
pieces and formats from inside the game, e.g. a king that moves like a
pawn but takes like a knight. You can make any board size and shape
with any starting pieces and position, then submit your new format for
others to buy and play.

You can try out an early prototype release at chess.squad.games.
