There is an incredible opportunity in the gaming industry for
supporting user generated content (mods) with marketplaces where
creators can sell their work and users can find it. We see a future in
which videogame development is far more diverse and varied than
it is today leading to a dramatically expanded audience as smaller
communities get market support for their work.

The Squad Games Platform offers a radical new way to build videogames
and financially support game devs, modders, and players.

We are hard at work building a decentralized protocol on the Ethereum
blockchain and the developer tools needed to develop videogames for
modding, allow everyone to retain ownership of their contributions,
earn revenue from their success, and curate the best games and mods
for the players who will love them.

*We are looking for design partners!* If this sounds interesting to
you, if you are making a moddable game and want to support your
modding community, please get in touch!  On Twitter
