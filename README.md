# Squad

Prototype Set Match Games platform on Holochain

As Set Match Games is to Valve, Squad will be to Steam.

Squad is the platform where game players and creators submit their contributions and browse contributions that have been submitted. All the things that Steam does internally (game vetting, game curating) will be done publicly, much through the SMG DAO.
