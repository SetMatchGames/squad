# Squad Paper

A cryptoeconomic mechanism for the decentralized development of video games (software?)

Proposition and curation are sufficient for progress.

## (Understand the problem)

* Games are hard to design and develop. They require lots of playtesting, the more people the better
* The most popular games at the time of this writing are based on community designed and developed mods
  * MOBAs
  * battle royales
  * Hero shooters

[Balancing games is super hard](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DanFelder/20151012/251443/Design_101_Balancing_Games.php)
"No matter how good you are at balancing, the collective intelligence of your players 
is going to outmatch you" - Dan Felder

### Participents, roles

* Users
  * People who pay for good games
* Contributors
  * Game designers, developers of game software, contributors of game definitions
  * Game developers, contributors of component and format definitions
* Governers
  * members of the governenance DAOs
  * Update the parameters and terms of participation of the system
* Investors
  * Purchasers of definition, or governance bonds

## (Devise a solution) (Logical model)

Design an efficient mechanism that rewards the collective intelligence fairly for their 
investment in and contributions to the design and development of video games.

* Metastore
* Curation Market
* Governance DAO

## (Carry out the plan) (Physical model)

* Holochain
* Ethereum Automatic Bonds
* DAOStack? Moloch? Homegrown?

## (Look back)

* This idea should work for any software, not just games.
* What about this system is "just for games" and would need to be changed or updated for this to work for more software systems?
* What software systems does this simply work for now?
* Should we rename our definitions (especially the "Game" type) to make it forward copatible?
* Should we rewrite the whole paper to apply to software?
  * squad.games would then become one of many possible app stores
