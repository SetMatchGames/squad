## An introduction to contributing to Squad
Before contributing, you should be familiar with [Squad](https://github.com/SetMatchGames/squad) and its architecture (needs link) and have a clear idea of what you're trying to achieve.

If you're not sure what type of contribution to make, you can look through unaddressed github issues or join our [discord](https://discord.gg/AKnbAe9) and ask for ideas. We'll be happy to give you something to do!

## Reporting bugs and suggesting features
If you've found a bug, please go to Squad's github issues, check if the bug has already been submitted, and if it hasn't, submit a new issue. Tag your issue with "bug" and use existing bug-tagged issues as examples for how to format your submission.

If you'd like to request a new feature or a change, follow the same protocol using the "suggestion" tag instead of "bug."
