# App Spec Design: Automatic Chess

## Concept
An [autobattler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_battler) based on regular chess! 
Players draft their pieces at the start of a game, arrange those pieces on the board, 
and then the two boards will play against each other using identical, basic, chess engines.

## Definitions
 - Game: Automatic Chess
 - Components: Pieces
 - Formats: Groups of pieces
 - Maybe (Mechanics: rules for movement that pieces reference)
 
## Gameplay Design
### Stage 1: Draft
### Stage 2: Piece placement
### Stage 3: Playing
