The Squad-SDK is a software development kit that supports community-designed video games. Building with the Squad-SDK will let you build a game that allows community created and curated components, formats, and other elements inside your game. With the SDK, a game's community can 1) submit game elements, 2) buy them, 3), curate them (via curation markets), and 4) license and profit off their contributions.
