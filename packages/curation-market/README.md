The Squad Curation Market is a part of the [Squad-SDK](/packages/squad-sdk/README.md) that lets users buy and sell tokens
representing game elements, lets creators make profit from these sales, and use curation markets to discover games and game elements.
The Curation Market is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses curved bonds to create token markets.
